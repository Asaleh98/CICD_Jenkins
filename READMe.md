- Java based program with packages for different OS's
- Support building, deploying and automating for projects

## Continuous integration
- After every commit the updated code is built and tested automatically
- Wikipedia definition
    - Practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Continuous Delivery (CD) is software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and when releasing the software, doing so manually
- Continuous Deployment (CDE) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments

## CICD Benefits
- Reduce cost
- Faster release rate
- Smaller code changes
- Fault isolation
- More test reliability
- Increase team transparency and accountability
- Easy maintenance
- hello
- hello
- hello
